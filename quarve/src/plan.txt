// so we have signals (need to decide on exact observation)
// - inline state and global state tree (i like this)
// - how should Observed be changed, not good right now
// - ok just have State and everything works out
// trans_maps (easy)
// event handlers (relatively normal + event streams)
// templates
// backings
// portals (using a conduit and .send) syntax
    // will be a bit tricky to make sure this works
    // multiple passes will probably fix things, and not a problem
// i think this is it? I think this will turn out well
